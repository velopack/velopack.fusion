# ‚ùó‚ùó This repository has been moved ‚ùó‚ùó
Velopack Fusion was an experimental project to transpile the "fut" language into other programming languages. This approach is no longer being used, and Velopack libraries for other languages have been integrated into the [Main Velopack Repo](https://github.com/velopack/velopack).

## Velopack Fusion

[Velopack](https://velopack.io) is an installer and automatic update framework for cross-platform desktop applications.

Fusion is the home for client libraries which assist developers integrating their applications with [Velopack](https://velopack.io). Fusion also provides a simple command line interface for downloading and staging updates, so if your language does not have a client library you can still use the CLI to integrate your app.

## How does Velopack Fusion actually work?
Velopack has two fully implemented reference libraries, [one for C#](https://github.com/velopack/velopack) and [one for Rust](https://github.com/velopack/velopack.fusion/tree/master/for-rust).

For other languages, the Rust library is compiled into a small binary (`vfusion.exe`) which exposes the core functionality as a CLI. 

The rest of the libraries available here are transpiled from [the fusion (fut) language](https://github.com/fusionlanguage/fut), which is a programming langauge which does not compile, and is designed to be transpiled into other languages. These light-weight transpiled libraries interface with the fusion cli to provide a native-like programming experience, which is why they require the fusion binary bundled with your application. 

## Compiling Fusion
There is a custom build system written in C#. To compile all of Fusion you can run the following commands in your terminal:
```txt
git clone https://github.com/velopack/velopack.fusion.git
cd velopack.fusion
dotnet run
```

### Prerequisites
Because we are targeting so many languages, to build and test each library you need the following installed:
- [Rust / Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Visual Studio C++ Workload](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
- [Node.js / npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
